(just forked this to add some info on compiling ofxOsc on windows+code::blocks)

Using ofxOSC on Windows/code::blocks
====================================
Everytime I had to use ofxOsc I had to change my linker settings in 
Code::blocks because I got undefined references to "htonl" etc.. 
You can fix this, by changin the order of linker libs. You've to make sure
that oscpack.a comes before libws2_32.a (or similar).
